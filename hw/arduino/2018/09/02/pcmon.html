<p>Lately I was using some resource-intensive programs at work and couldn’t reserve screen space for the task manager, in order to keep tabs on the CPU and RAM use.</p>

<p>To solve this problem I decided to create an external device which could show those values I was interested in. But I also wanted to create something striking to have on my desk. I decided to use a pair of analog VU-meters to reach the desired goals.</p>

<h3 id="programming">PROGRAMMING</h3>
<p>The system is composed of a server and a client applciation.</p>

<h4 id="server">Server</h4>
<p>The server app is a .NET console app I quickly whipped out on Visual Studio. I didn’t want to invest any time here.</p>

<p>The program reads the system resource values, adapts them to a 0-100 percent range and sends them to the client arduino app via serial communication.</p>

<h4 id="client-arduino">Client (Arduino)</h4>
<p>The client app is an Arduino program. It reads the values passed from the server via serial, does a little processing and shows them in the VU-meters.</p>

<p>As you’ll see in the <em>Electronics</em> section the VU-meters aren’t but a pair of modified voltage meters. In order to show any value on them the arduino just needs to generate a voltage in a given range. That’s accomplished via PWM output.</p>

<p>There are also a pair of RGB LED strips. These change colour based on the load of the system. Up to 60% load the Arduino just uses a blue-ish tint. But when the values climb above that threshold the colour becomes warmer, ranging from yellow to red.</p>

<p>To do this colour progression I decided to use the HSV colourspace and alter the <em>hue</em> proportionally to the value shown in the VU-meter. This was an incredible simple way to implement this functionality.</p>

<h3 id="electronics">ELECTRONICS</h3>
<p>The base of this system is an Arduino UNO board. Only 3 of the PWM outputs are used to make everything work.</p>

<h4 id="vu-meters">VU-meters</h4>
<p>The VU-meters are a pair of voltage meters I bought on ebay. Their original range was 0-15V, I opened them up and changed the resistor they had inside to make them work on a 0-3.3V range, originally I was going to use a NodeMCU board as the brains.</p>

<p>I then scanned the voltmeter’s panel and designed with GIMP a new one for CPU values and another one for RAM values. I printed them and stuck them over the original panel.</p>

<p>To show a value on the VU-meter the arduino just has to generate a specific voltage on the 0-3.3V range via one of the PWM ports.</p>

<h4 id="led-sticks">LED sticks</h4>
<p>I used a pair of LED sticks to give a sort of backlight to the VU-meters.</p>

<p>Originally I didn’t want to create backlightning, just a way to warn me when the meters reached their max values. To achieve this I wanted to use a simple red LED, but I didn’t have anywhere to put it and didn’t have the tools to modify the VU-meters’ enclosure.</p>

<p>I then used the LED sticks to make the meters glow when their max values where reached, but wanted to create a cooler effect. All in all, RGB LEDs are capable of much more than just what I inteded to use them for.</p>

<p>Due to some problems with Adaruit’s neopixel library I found and ended up using the <a href="http://fastled.io/">fastled</a> library to drive the LED sticks. This library also allowed me to use the HSV colourspace and solve the color-progression problem easily.</p>

<h3 id="exterior">EXTERIOR</h3>
<p>In order to make the device self-contained I started to design a simple enclosure with CAD software, but soon it become clear that it would be pretty big. In order to avoid printing large pieces I only printed the front panel, which on its backside has supports for the heavy VU-meters.</p>

<p>The rest of the enclosure was made with a cardboard box and taped together.</p>
